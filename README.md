Muze is a smartphone app for iOS and Android to easily follow your favorite artists and get notified when their songs hit the top charts.

This is the Flutter app repository. It is developed by members of N.O.W. Mozilla Club at NMIMS.

## Building

To build and run the app on your device, do the following:

-   Install Flutter by following the instructions on their [website](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/).
-   Clone this repo to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/nowmozillaclub/muze-app.git`.
-   Replace all the encrypted files with your own as explained in [ENCRYPTION.md](ENCRYPTION.md).
-   Connect your devices/emulators and run the app using `flutter run` in the root of the project directory.
